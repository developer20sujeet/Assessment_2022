WCF Provide three Important Security feature : CIA
Confidentiality  : Encrypting Messages mitigate eavesdropping attack
Integrity	 : Signing Messages Mitigate tampering and Replay attacks
Authentication   : Proof of identity mitigate Spoofing and impersonation attacks

signed vs encrypted 
all bindin securit at transport layer or message layer

Protection level : a way of developer to force administartor to use binding that support sining and encription
------------------------

On A particular Message
on indivisual operation and fault contract
on service contract

if protection lvel set by developer as stated above . host will fail if the required protection lvel is not met by endpoint

use protection level propeerty on attribute 

----------------------
Configuring security in Binding

there is two fundamental configuration option for 
security that is 

1)Security mode: Message , transport mixed
2) Client Credentail Type : Username , Certificate,windiow,Issuedtoken



---------------------------
Transport security

each transport has built in security layer like
HTTP using SSL
TCP/IP  unsing Kerberos

it provide point to point security between node , it is ideal when there
message not travel through intermediaries like router switch briade rtc

Transport security tradeoff
-- mature , better performance
-- drawback 
----- point to point authentication
------ Constraint the type of  clinet crdetail

--------------------------------
----------------------
Message security
-- Provide end to end security across all nodes
-- messahe security pushes authentication down into SOAP Header

Message security tradoff
-- Support wide variety of credentail
-- end to end authentication
drawback
---Newer is not always better for security
-- Performance can be significantly worse

----------------------------------------------
ClientCrdentialType
-- Select the type of credential the clinet must present
-- Also Implicitly dictates the type of crdetial the server must posses

kinds of ClientCrdentialType
-----None , userName,Certificate,Window,Basic,Digest,IssueToken

----------------------------------------------------------------

Type of client Credential in message security
None
Windows
Username
Certificate
Issued token

-------------------------------------------------

7. How we can use MessageContract partially with DataContract for a service operation in WCF?

MessageContract must be used all or none. If we are using MessageContract into an operation signature, then we must use MessageContract as the only parameter type and as the return type of the operation.
